Here we argue that the time taken to carry out these actions provides an additional signal that supports goal recognition. We present a behavioral experiment confirming that people use timing information in this way, and develop and evaluate a goal recognition algorithm that is sensitive to both actions and timing information. Our results suggest that existing goal recognition algorithms can be improved by incorporating a model of planning time on both synthetic data and human data, and that these improvements can be substantial in scenarios in which relatively few actions have been observed.}, number={1}, journal={Proceedings of the International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling}, author={Zhang, Chenyuan and Kemp, Charles and Lipovetzky, Nir}, year={2023}, month={Jul.}, pages={443-451} }

  abstract={Understanding problem solving or planning has been a shared challenge for both AI and cognitive science since the birth of both fields. We explore the extent to which modern planners from the field of AI can account for human performance on the Tower of London (TOL) task, a close relative of the Tower of Hanoi problem that has been extensively studied by psychologists. We characterize the task using the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) and evaluate an adaptive online planner and a family of well-known planners, including online planners, optimal planners and satisficing planners. Each planner is evaluated based on its ability to predict the actions and planning times of participants in a new behavioral experiment. Our results suggest that participants use a range of strategies but that an adaptive lookahead planner provides the best overall account of both human actions and human planning times. This finding is consistent with the view that humans differ from standard AI planners by integrating a mechanism for evidence accumulation.}
